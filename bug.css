The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where using a pseudo-element with a sibling combinator unexpectedly affects the styling of other elements.

```css
div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div + p::before {
  content: "Sibling:";
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: green;
}
```

The intention is that only the `p` element immediately following the `div` will have the `::before` pseudo-element. However, due to the way the sibling combinator interacts with pseudo-elements, other `p` elements might also be affected, potentially leading to unexpected styling.
