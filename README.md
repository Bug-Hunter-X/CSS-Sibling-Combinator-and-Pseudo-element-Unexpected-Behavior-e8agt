# CSS Sibling Combinator and Pseudo-element Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the interaction between the sibling combinator (`+`) and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`).  The bug showcases how using a sibling combinator with a pseudo-element can unexpectedly affect the styling of other elements, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution to mitigate this issue.

## Bug Description
The sibling combinator (`+`) usually targets the immediately following sibling element. However, when combined with a pseudo-element, this behavior can become inconsistent. The main issue is that the effects might cascade to other elements which are not intended to be affected.

## Solution
The solution is to use more specific selectors to target the intended elements precisely, avoiding any cascading effects from the pseudo-element.
