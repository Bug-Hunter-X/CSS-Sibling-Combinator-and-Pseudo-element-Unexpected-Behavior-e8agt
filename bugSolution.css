The solution involves using more specific selectors to target the intended element precisely.  Avoid relying solely on the sibling combinator with pseudo-elements when the context might introduce unexpected side effects.

```css
div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div + p {
  color: green;
}

div + p::before {
  content: "Sibling:";
  color: blue;
  display: inline;
}

/*Other <p> elements remain unaffected*/
p {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that only the paragraph immediately following the `div` receives the `::before` pseudo-element and its corresponding styling.  The addition of `display: inline;` on the pseudo-element improves its behavior. We also added a separate rule for the `p` element ensuring other paragraphs are unaffected.
